      <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
      <p>This ranking is not serious. This is not meant to be a scientific, well-thought experiment. Most of this is subjective, and even the objective parts are not entirely logical. This was a fun comedic passion project :3 in the end, maybe you can have a nice conversation with your pals about your favorite snacks</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Snacks are practically essentials for the life of a Pisay student. A good snack could make a bad day great when
        used properly. Of course, not all snacks are created equal. Some snacks are better than others. All in all, we
        need to find the best snacks to maximize enjoyment in pisay. </p>
      <p>Since having one snack for the rest of highschool would be irrational, we will be ranking 10 snacks. We would
        rank more, but we simply do not have the time nor funding to buy that many snacks.</p>

      <h2>Mechanics of Ranking</h2>
      <p>Though this ranking will have a basis in fact(availability of and residue left by snack), it will also include
        our opinions(taste). As such, these three will be the dependent variables in our ranking:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>availability</li>
        <li>taste</li>
        <li>residue</li>
      </ul>
