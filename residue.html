  <h1>Residue</h1>
  <section>
    <p>Snacks are meant to be eaten in a short amount of time. Residue that we have to clean up (because we have angelic morals) will only add time that we may not have. Which is why the crumbs and wrappers that we have to clean is an important consideration in choosing the best snack. We will score the residue of the snack in a scale of 0.00 to 1.00, with a baseline 0.50 for Oreos, just for a frame of reference.</p>

          <td>Basically the carbon copy of Oreo, it's crumby and can get a bit messy. It's also an oilier version for some reason (man they gotta cut down on those MSGs)</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Eggnog Cookies</td>
          <td>Moderately crumby but can still leave a mess. Since it's bit-sized, you can bite it in one go, leaving minimal crumbs.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Oreo</td>
          <td>Totally a rip-off of Cream-O, it's also just as crumby but not as soft and actually not oily (Ok I know what I said but I'd still eat it on the bed or couch because why not)</td>
          <td>0.50</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Bread Stix</td>
          <td>Leaves slightly less crumbs than Eggnog, although they're from the same brand. </td>
          <td>0.90</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dewberry</td>
          <td>Sugary and crumby on the hands and table (if you eat on one anyways) but GOD do I love the middle filling.</td>
          <td>0.65</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Loaded</td>
          <td>Rip-off of Pillows and is pretty powdery, just as much as Pillows (That's enough defamation for today please don't file a lawsuit against me)</td>
          <td>0.40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Butter Toast</td>
          <td>Crunchy, but messy and sugary. Come to think of it all these snacks leave a mess.</td>
          <td>0.30</td>
