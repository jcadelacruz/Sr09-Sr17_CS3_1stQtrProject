  <h1>Conclusion</h1> 
  <h3>How the grading will work</h3>
  <p>Have you ever sometimes wondered what goes through the mind of the observer? when you're there to see, all there is is sheer comprehension and a metaphorically empty space filled in with the satisfaction of merely "seeing". Placeholder text.</p>
  <h3>The scores:</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>

  <h3>Final ranking:</h3>
  <p>I feel as if I've been overtaken by a gradual descent into madness as the personification of my mindless facade of happiness lingers and solidifies to become the person you see, touch and interact. There is joy in the temporal silence, but there is also ultimate unrest in the never-receding waters of contemplation. This is the ultimate fate I had decided for myself from the start. I had sold my peace of mind for a heart that doesn't even realize it's been blessed with the precense of another seeing, feeling heart. Each day, they unite and find ways to laugh and play as they walk under the warm, embracing rays of the sun. Was it right? Is it right for me to feel this way towards the immovable, the inevitable? Silently, the figure of my sillouete will melt away into the endless, pitch black shadows of the eclipse as I lose my soul to the countless sins and transgressions I have due of me. I had wronged him in that regard, and I am likely to feel, see and fail all over again, under the eyes of the Benevolent Beholder. Placeholder text.</p>
